# knetbot
knetbot is a twitch bot which is running on a raspberry pi 3

ADDING COMMANDS:

you can manually add commands in commlist.txt with:

channel +user -trigger *reply ||| or with more channels/users ||| channel1 channel2 +user1 user2 -trigger *reply

while the bot is running, you can also add commands with !addcomm and the same formatting as above.

TIP: if you want the command to trigger on all channels/users: all +all -trigger +reply works as well

delete a comment with !delcomm channel +user -trigger *reply is not important
